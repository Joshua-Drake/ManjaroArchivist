# ManjaroArchivist

Manjaro Archivist is a simple browser extension that redirects users from the dreaded 'Page not found' met when trying to access an old forum post on https://forum.manjaro.org.
The extension waits until a user visits the forum subdomain of the website manjaro.org, and automatically prepends 'archived.' before the rest of the URL.

This extension checks whether a page is found or not before it executes the code that redirects the user, so this will not prevent users from accessing the new Manjaro forum.
